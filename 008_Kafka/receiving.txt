This interesting and important legal\r\n""problem was discussed at great length at several international\r\n""conferences at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the\r\n""twentieth century. A kind of ethical and legal code resulted consisting\r\n""of a comprehensive body of rules and regulations, both written and\r\n""unwritten. The International Red Cross played an important part in the\r\n""development and crystallization of those humanitarian ideals as they are\r\n""embodied today in the provisions of the international law concerning\r\n""prisoners of war. Its rules have been explicitly or tacitly accepted and\r\n""to a great extent put into practice by most of the civilized nations of\r\n""the world. Their disregard, as in the recently reported case of 115\r\n""helpless American military prisoners of war murdered in cold blood by\r\n""the Germans near Malmedy, or in the notorious death camps of Oswiecim\r\n""and Belsen-Bergen, is a relapse into barbarism, characteristic of the\r\n""Hitlerite hordes. As a rule, however, the status of prisoners of war is\r\n""universally respected and they receive a fair treatment from all\r\n""nations, in accordance with the rules of international law. They may be\r\n""employed by their captors for certain labors, but must be accorded fair\r\n""living conditions.\r\n""\r\n""Considerations of war economy and corresponding military precautions\r\n""created the necessity of issuing special money for the use of prisoners\r\n""of war. A shortage in currency is often an unavoidable result of\r\n""national war conditions. It would be greatly increased, of course, if\r\n""the actual use of national currency would be permitted also to the\r\n""rising numbers of captives. The issuance of special currency for the\r\n""exclusive use of war prisoners is therefore an act of national defense\r\n""in wartime. The use of this special type of money, for which both paper\r\n""and metal are employed, is restricted in a twofold way. Its circulation\r\n""is limited to war prisoners, and\u2014even more strictly\u2014to definite\r\n""internment camps. The prisoners\u2019 specially made money, often easily\r\n""distinguishable through a round or square hole in the center, is\r\n""excluded from general monetary circulation. The prisoner is not able to\r\n""buy articles in the ordinary channels of the national commerce.\r\n""Moreover, he is left without means in case of escape.\r\n""\r\n""These are the ideas and motives underlying the issuance of separate\r\n""money for prisoners of war.\r\n""\r\n""    [Illustration: Austrian War-Prisoner Money Used in the Officers\r\n""    Prison Camp M\u00fchling\r\n""    (Courtesy of the American Numismatic Society)]\r\n""\r\n""During the First World War such money was produced by the warring\r\n""nations of Europe. In Germany, where 635,000 allied prisoners were\r\n""confined at the end of the war, it was called _Gefangenenlagergeld_; in\r\n""France, with the greatest number of German war prisoners (400,000), it\r\n""was known as _monnaies des camps de prisonniers_. In Germany production\r\n""reached tremendous amounts and resulted in almost unbelievable\r\n""varieties, far surpassing the needs dictated by war economy and military\r\n""policy. R\u00f6ttinger\u2019s catalogue of German internment camp money lists\r\n""about 1360 different places of issue and authorities competent to issue\r\n""such money. There were thousands of types and varieties. All kinds of\r\n""material were used and all types of style imaginable were represented.\r\n""From these facts another motif comes to light which prompted that mass\r\n""production of war prisoner money. Apparently this new type of currency\r\n""quickly attracted the attention of numismatists, first in the lands of\r\n""its origin, then in the adjacent neutral countries, and later in the\r\n""entire world. The interest of collectors and students once awakened was\r\n""soon exploited by the German government through a mass export of\r\n""complete sets of prisoner currency to foreign countries. Thus a means\r\n""was provided of obtaining valuable and badly needed foreign exchange for\r\n""a worthless kind of currency. In fact it was a practically worthless\r\n""kind of money, worthless even from the numismatic point of view. For the\r\n""almost innumerable varieties impaired the collector\u2019s interest who could\r\n""not entertain any hope ever to obtain a complete collection. While\r\n""Germany continued this practice for the duration of the war, in line\r\n""with her general inflationary policy, Austria-Hungary seems to have kept\r\n""the issuance of her war prisoner money within the limits of the actual\r\n""war needs.\r\n""\r\n""The hypothesis of the partly inflationary character of the German\r\n""internment camp money during the First World War and of its doubtful\r\n""numismatical value, as set forth here, is borne out by several other\r\n""observations. There were very few complete or almost complete\r\n""collections of \u201cGefangenenlagergeld\u201d even in Germany, the most important\r\n""ones being that of the _Reichswirtschaftsmuseum_ in Leipzig, where one\r\n""specimen of each type of _Notgeld_ was officially deposited by the\r\n""_Reich_ as issued, and that of a private collector, Doctor Arnold Keller\r\n""of Berlin, the publisher of _Dr. Arnold Kellers Notgeldb\u00fccher_. In\r\n""Holland, there was also a collection outstanding because of its\r\n""completeness, namely that of Mr. Paul Daub of Utrecht, a private\r\n""collector. The American Numismatic Society, in due recognition of the\r\n""given situation, rightfully did not care to acquire complete sets of\r\n""this money, either during or after the war, but contented itself with a\r\n""few specimens only. There have been a few private collectors in the\r\n""United States none of whom seems to have attained great achievements in\r\n""this field. None the less, the interest is still kept alive to some\r\n""degree in collectors\u2019 circles through the \u201cInternational Emergency Money\r\n""Club\u201d of New York City, the only club of its kind in existence, founded\r\n""in 1936 in New York City, with an active membership of thirty in 1942.\r\n""\r\n""    [Illustration: Different Types of War Prisoner Money]\r\n""\r\n""Beginning as early as January 1917 the well known firm of J. Schulman of\r\n""Amsterdam offered complete sets of such money in a series of consecutive\r\n""catalogues on war money, entitled _La Guerre Europ\u00e9enne 1914-1917_. Here\r\n""collectors could obtain almost all sets available which were probably\r\n""secured from the official authorities of issuance in Germany. The\r\n""international reputation of the firm of Schulman in Amsterdam is too\r\n""well established to permit reflection on the ethics of its business\r\n""transactions. Merely for the sake of clarity it should be stated that\r\n""none is implied here.\r\n""\r\n""Obviously, numismatic interest turned quickly to the items of this\r\n""previously little known type of war emergency money. In the very\r\n""beginning, most probably, everyone thought that it would be a quickly\r\n""passing numismatic phenomenon. No one could at that time realize the\r\n""dimensions that production of war prisoner money would finally reach.\r\n""All this notwithstanding, the literature on this special kind of money\r\n""is scarce, incomplete and widely scattered. The appended select\r\n""bibliography might therefore be welcome to those interested in this\r\n""field of collecting which probably will be revived soon after the return\r\n""of peace. It is needless to state that no claim is being made of\r\n""completeness in the bibliographical data offered below.\r\n""\r\n""No doubt, in the present war, too, internment camp money has been\r\n""issued. Scanty news on such money issued in Great Britain, particularly\r\n""in the Isle of Man internment camp for civilian and soldier prisoners of\r\n""war, has already been brought to the attention of numismatists. A member\r\n""of the Czechoslovak State Council in London, Mr. Ernest Frischer,\r\n""recently informed the present writer that internment camp money is in\r\n""use in the ill-famed concentration camp of Terezin (Theresienstadt) in\r\n""Bohemia, where about 50,000 Jews are being held by their German\r\n""\u201cProtectors.\u201d According to information received by the War Department in\r\n""Washington, on the other hand, \u201cno special type of money is issued for\r\n""the use of prisoners of war held in this country. However, prisoners of\r\n""war are issued 'canteen checks,\u2019 a form of script which is given them in\r\n""lieu of cash. This script is redeemable for merchandise at prison camp\r\n""post exchanges. This script is not uniform, each of the several Service\r\n""Commands procuring it and issuing it to camps within its jurisdiction.\r\n""No photographs of the canteen checks are available.\u201d\r\n""\r\n""Naturally, more detailed and definite information will be available only\r\n""after the termination of hostilities and the restoration of unimpeded\r\n""research channels.\r\n""\r\n""\r\n""                                   II\r\n""                      European War-Prisoner Medals\r\n""\r\n""With regard to war prisoner medals, the numismatic situation is\r\n""completely different from that outlined here for internment camp money.\r\n""True, there may have been also a \u201cmass production\u201d of such medallic\r\n""items in Europe during the war of 1914-1918. But it never could have\r\n""paralleled that of the emergency money for internment camps.\r\n""\r\n""Two motives, above all, caused the issuance of war prisoner medals: the\r\n""raising of funds for the support of prisoners of war or the amelioration\r\n""of their condition; and the creation of the commemorative tokens or\r\n""medals for presentation to captives after their liberation. It is\r\n""doubtful and highly improbable, that the \u201cmass production\u201d of such\r\n""medals ever reached in quantity a volume equal to that of war prisoners\r\n""money. The number issued may well run into hundreds, at most a few\r\n""thousands, but certainly not many thousands. For, to the best of this\r\n""author\u2019s knowledge, no commemorative war medal in the form of an\r\n""official decoration to be given to all war prisoners in general was\r\n""issued by any of the states participating in the First World War. Nor\r\n""did any of the European states that remained neutral and held members of\r\n""the belligerents in internment camps, issue commemorative medals for\r\n""internees. This suggestion may well deserve the attention of the United\r\n""Nations\u2019 military authorities. After the present war a special\r\n""commemorative medal of honor should be issued, intended for those who\r\n""had to endure the great hardships of captivity for their country, often\r\n""suffering undescribable physical and mental restraint. Such a token of\r\n""gratitude would show to these heroes that they, too, had not been\r\n""forgotten and that their sacrifice is duly appreciated and will\r\n""permanently be remembered.\r\n""\r\n""It seems that in the last European war prisoner medals were issued\r\n""privately only. The extensive search for such medals carried on by the\r\n""author in numismatic literature and dealers\u2019 catalogues as well as\r\n""through interviewing of collectors and dealers, yielded only four items.\r\n""Three are of German origin, only one is French. None of these medals has\r\n""aroused as yet the attention or curiosity of numismatists in general or\r\n""of collectors of medals in particular.\r\n""\r\n""    [Illustration: German Capture Medal by L. Gies]\r\n""\r\n""Because of its medallic representation a typically German \u201cwar medal\u201d\r\n""will be mentioned first. No specimen was available to this writer. None\r\n""is found in the Museum of the American Numismatic Society in New York\r\n""City. It is a unilateral bronze medal, measuring 64 millimeters in\r\n""diameter, designed by the German artist. Ludwig Gies, whose initials\r\n""L.G. appear on the obverse. It is one of the numerous \u201cwar medals\u201d\r\n""created by him in the beginning of the First World War. It depicts the\r\n""act of capture. A German soldier is shown capturing and taking away a\r\n""French, a Russian, an English, Belgian, Serbian, and a colonial native\r\n""prisoner of war. A brief description, but no reproduction of this medal,\r\n""is found in J. Schulman\u2019s Catalogue LXV, of April 1916, p. 82, No. 809.\r\n""It is pictured among the artist\u2019s other war medals in Max Bernhart\u2019s\r\n""_Die Muenchener Medaillenkunst der Gegenwart_, Plate 15, No. 102,\r\n""wherefrom the reproduction is made.\r\n""\r\n""The medal reproduced here as No. 1, another German war prisoner medal,\r\n""is a silver medal, of 37.67 grams, measuring forty-one millimeters in\r\n""diameter. The obverse depicts the full figure of a German prisoner of\r\n""war, dressed in his uniform, on which a sign PG (French: _prisonnier de\r\n""guerre_) is visible. Standing on the shore of a river, being of course\r\n""the Rhine, he holds his hands stretched out to express his fervent\r\n""longing for his home country. Not only the mountains of the latter are\r\n""visible on the opposite shore but also the home village with its little\r\n""church in the foreground. The inscription in the left upper space of the\r\n""medal, before the soldier\u2019s eyes, reads: SEHNSUCHT (longing). The\r\n""reverse bears the following inscription in a quadrangular space\r\n""surrounded by ornaments: VOLKSBUND/ZUM SCHUTZE/DER DEUTSCHEN/KRIEGS u.\r\n""ZIVIL/GEFANGENEN, meaning, \u201cNational Society for the Protection of\r\n""German Military and Civil Prisoners of War.\u201d On the rim of the medal\r\n""name and place of the producing firm are visible: C. Poellat,\r\n""Schrobenhausen. The designer\u2019s name does not appear on the medal. No\r\n""year is given. In accordance with the aims of the issuing society the\r\n""medal was probably destined to promote interest in and support of the\r\n""German prisoners of war in enemy land. No records or accounts of the\r\n""activities of this society were available in this country. Nevertheless\r\n""it is safe to assume the following. Sending of food parcels from Germany\r\n""was possible only in the first years of war. But even later, in the\r\n""period of grave food shortage, funds were still needed and actually\r\n""raised for clothing, and particularly for books, which were continuously\r\n""sent to prisoner camps in great quantities. A specimen of this medal is\r\n""in the collection of Dr. Bruno Kisch, New York City.\r\n""\r\n""    [Illustration: No. 1\r\n""    German Volksbund for Prisoners Medal]\r\n""\r\n""There is a French counterpart to this medal. A small medal, 26\r\n""millimeters in diameter, similar to No. 1 in its motives, but apparently\r\n""more artistically designed, is known to have been struck in France. No\r\n""specimen is available in this country. According to the brief\r\n""description in J. Schulman\u2019s Catalogue LXXIII it was designed by O.\r\n""Yencesse and executed in a silvery white metal. The obverse shows a\r\n""French soldier seated in an attitude of despondency. The inscription\r\n""reads: POUR NOS\u2014PRISONNIERS. that is: \u201cFor Our Prisoners.\u201d On the\r\n""reverse a dove is visible bearing in its bill an olive branch. Below is\r\n""the date 1916. The motive of the issuance of this medal was patently\r\n""fund raising.\r\n""\r\n""No. 2 is a medal made of hard white metal, and struck for the German\r\n""prisoners of war interned at Douglas, Isle of Man, to commemorate their\r\n""detention there. Its diameter measures 46 millimeters. On the top there\r\n""is a rectangular vertical loophole. The obverse shows the Douglas prison\r\n""camp, in the foreground its barracks and huts, also an unfolded banner\r\n""is visible; in the background a fortress at the left of the beholder,\r\n""and a lighthouse at the right. Between the fortress and the lighthouse\r\n""is the Manx triskelion or triquerta, occupying a prominent place in the\r\n""upper center. The entire picture on the obverse is enclosed by a\r\n""surrounding wreath of barbed wire. The reverse has a wreath of leaves\r\n""with a panel in the middle. The inscription reads, in the upper segment:\r\n""WELTKRIEG 1914-1915 (\u201cWorld War 1914-1915\u201d); in the lower: DOUGLAS ISLE\r\n""OF MAN; in the middle: ERINNERUNG AN DIE KRIEGSHAFT (\u201cIn commemoration\r\n""of war detention\u201d). No artist\u2019s name is given. Specimens of this medal\r\n""are found in the museum of the American Numismatic Society, New York\r\n""City, and in this writer\u2019s collection. The first mentioned specimen is\r\n""in an (original) plain wooden case with no ornament. Other wooden cases\r\n""are known, on the cover of which an inlaid design is visible\r\n""representing an open-jawed snake as the symbol of war. The words\r\n""_Weltkrieg 1914/15_ are added on the case. This medal was pictured and\r\n""briefly, though not exactly, described in _The New York Times_ of August\r\n""26, 1916. In The Numismatist of March 1916, a reproduction with a few\r\n""explanatory lines was also published, the medal having been exhibited at\r\n""the January meeting of the New York Numismatic Club.\r\n""\r\n""    [Illustration: No. 2\r\n""    German Camp Douglas Medal]\r\n""\r\n""Douglas, Peel and Knockaloe had been chosen as sites for the detention\r\n""camps on the Isle of Man. Here many an alien who for years had followed\r\n""some profession or trade in Great Britain was interned in 1914 for the\r\n""duration of the war. The English and German Relief Committees with the\r\n""active cooperation of the American Young Men\u2019s Christian Association\r\n""succeeded in performing what seemed to the _New York Times_\r\n""correspondent at that time to have been an unheard-of feat under the\r\n""existing conditions: the establishment of an art school for prisoners of\r\n""war at Camp Douglas. Beside wooden boxes done in chip carving and in\r\n""wood intaglio, the commemorative medals for German war prisoners were\r\n""certainly the most artistic objects produced there. Through a strange\r\n""irony of fate, they were strictly \u201cmade in England.\u201d \u201cSome day they will\r\n""be of historic value,\u201d said the _New York Times_ correspondent in\r\n""concluding his article. The art school was established in 1915.

No war prisoners money or\r\n""medal originating in the last war is known to the author. In his\r\n""collection, however, five related items are found, four small tokens and\r\n""one large medal, which are deserving the historian\u2019s and medallist\u2019s\r\n""attention. All of them picture war prisons of ill fame. Four pertain to\r\n""the Revolutionary War, the fifth to the Civil War. Thus it is pertinent\r\n""to consider them all in this connection.\r\n""\r\n""    [Illustration: No. 3A\r\n""    The Old Provoost, New York]\r\n""\r\n""Nos. 3 A, 3 B, 4 and 5 are copper tokens, each 31 millimeters in\r\n""diameter. They are not \u201chistorical\u201d items in that they have come down to\r\n""us as immediate witnesses from the period of the Revolutionary War. They\r\n""are rather medallic creations of an outspoken commercial character, but\r\n""nevertheless \u201chistorical\u201d tokens.

No. 4 in the present\r\n""numbering is identical with No. 2, and No. 5 with No. 5 of the same\r\n""series. On the first page of his _Catalogue of Coins, Medals and\r\n""Tokens_, No. 1, of February 1859, Mr. Sage announced that \u201cthis series\r\n""will consist of about 25 tokens, each one giving a correct\r\n""representation of some public building around which there is anything of\r\n""an historical interest.\u201d No more than fourteen tokens were actually\r\n""issued of this series. All of them were advertised in Mr. Sage\u2019s later\r\n""catalogue of June 1859. They were executed in copper plain edge and in\r\n""copper and brass with reeded edges. In 1859, the set was offered for\r\n""sale for $4.00. Mules in copper, brass, and tin are known. Of No. 1 and\r\n""No. 6 two dies were made: in both cases the original die showed some\r\n""mistakes in picture or legend which were corrected in the second die. In\r\n""Chapman\u2019s catalogue of the Bushnell collection a specimen of No. 1 in\r\n""silver is listed as No. 462.

On the front side of the building at the\r\n""level of the main floor an empty space is visible. It was probably\r\n""designated in the draft for a gate or entrance door which is, however,\r\n""missing. The building is surrounded by a fence.

Davis\u2019s (1803-1892) drawing that was engraved by Alexander\r\n""Anderson (1775-1870) and reproduced in _The New York Mirror_ of\r\n""September 10, 1831, in John Pintard\u2019s article, \u201cThe Old Jail.\u201d\r\n""\r\n""The site of this \u201cmodern bastille\u201d was City Hall Park. It was built as\r\n""the second jail, in succession, in the City of New York in 1757 and\r\n""completed in 1759. In the revolutionary period it was memorable during\r\n""the occupation of the City by the British forces, from 1776 to 1783, as\r\n""a British military prison, known as \u201cProvost\u201d and later as \u201cMartyr\u2019s\r\n""Prison\u201d, still later as \u201cDebtor\u2019s Prison\u201d. In 1830 it was reconstructed\r\n""and fitted to receive public records, henceforth known as \u201cRegister\u2019s\r\n""Office\u201d or \u201cHall of Records\u201d. It was finally demolished in 1903 to make\r\n""way for the Subway. Coins, buttons, and human bones were found in the\r\n""excavation. A tablet, erected in 1907, on a granite monument in the Park\r\n""still marks the site of the \u201cOld Provost.\u201d\r\n""\r\n""This British military prison, under the superintendence of the ill-famed\r\n""Captain Cunningham, Provost-Marshall\u2014from whom it took its name\u2014and his\r\n""deputy, Sergeant Keefe, was the scene of great brutalities to American,\r\n""or, in the language of the times, \u201crebel\u201d prisoners during the\r\n""Revolution. The Provost was destined, as John Pintard, the meritorious\r\n""New York historian, tells us, for the more notorious rebels, civil,\r\n""naval, and military. An admission into this prison was enough to appall\r\n""the stoutest heart. On the second floor, called derisively \u201cCongress\r\n""Hall,\u201d prisoners of note were confined, citizens of distinction and many\r\n""American officers, among them the famous Colonel Ethan Allen and Judge\r\n""Fell, of Bergen county, New Jersey. Could these dumb walls speak, John\r\n""Pintard exclaims, what scenes of anguish, what tales of agonizing woe,\r\n""might they disclose. In his aforementioned article he gave a vivid\r\n""account of the \u201cOld Jail\u2019s\u201d history well known to him from the personal\r\n""reminiscences of many a distinguished prisoner still living in his day.\r\n""\r\n""For naval \u201crebels\u201d a similar function as that of the \u201cOld Provost\u201d for\r\n""civil and military \u201crebels\u201d was fulfilled by \u201cprison-ships.\u201d On board of\r\n""such vessels seamen were subjected to every possible hardship, to compel\r\n""them to enter into the British service. As is well known, prison-ships\r\n""were old vessels-of-war which had been condemned as unseaworthy, and\r\n""unfit for store or hospital ships, and converted to this, the last use\r\n""to which they could be applied. One of them has gained medallic\r\n""interest, the \u201c_Old Jersey Prison Ship_,\u201d which was included as No. 5 in\r\n""A. B.

Underneath one\r\n""reads: No. 5.\r\n""\r\n""The prison-ship _Jersey_ built in 1736 was a fourth-rate ship of the\r\n""line, mounting sixty guns, and carrying a crew of four hundred men. She\r\n""was first used as one of the Channel fleet, later sent repeatedly to the\r\n""Mediterranean Sea, to Spain, the West Indies, Newfoundland, and was\r\n""active in several naval engagements. Already in 1747 the _Jersey_ was\r\n""laid up as evidently unfit for active service. On the renewal of\r\n""hostilities with France, in 1756, she was refitted for service and again\r\n""operated in the Mediterranean. She continued in active service until\r\n""1763 when she returned to England and was laid up once more. But in 1766\r\n""the _Jersey_ was again commissioned and sailed for America in 1769. At\r\n""that time, the active duty of that ship appears to have been brought to\r\n""a close, since she remained out of commission from 1769 to 1776. In this\r\n""year the _Jersey_ was ordered, without armament, to New York as a\r\n""hospital-ship. In the latter part of the year 1781 she was fitted as a\r\n""prison-ship and was used for that purpose during the remainder of the\r\n""Revolutionary War. \u201cShe remained until the termination of the British\r\n""authority in New York, when she was abandoned to the fate to which she\r\n""was justly entitled, and was subsequently overwhelmed in the mud of the\r\n""Wale bogt, where she remains to this day.\u201d An abundant literature of\r\n""memoirs, letters, and lists of the prisoners tells the story of this\r\n""prison-ship and its inmates by whose blood and sufferings the\r\n""independence of the United States and the civil and religious privileges\r\n""all of us can now enjoy, were achieved and purchased.\r\n""\r\n""    [Illustration: No. 5\r\n""    City Hall, Wall Street, New York]\r\n""\r\n""Two more of Sage\u2019s tokens have undertaken to memorialize other Civil War\r\n""prisons.

The space between the third and\r\n""fourth story of the front is occupied by the number 1763, the year of\r\n""its foundation, as the legend says. The space between the uppermost\r\n""window on the gable front and the two lower windows has as inscription\r\n""these letters: BRS. All windows are grated.

Y.,\u201d which stood on the corner of\r\n""Rose and Deane Streets in New York City, was erected by Henry Cuyler,\r\n""Jr., for his heir, Barnet Rynders Cuyler, probably in 1763. This date,\r\n""which appears on the medal twice, is based on an authority \u201cwho had\r\n""opportunity to observe.\u201d John Austin Stevens stated from personal\r\n""recollection \u201cthat he saw the date 1769 high upon the brick wall in iron\r\n""figures.\u201d The good engraving which is reproduced in James G. Wilson\u2019s\r\n""_Memorial History of the City of New York_ and may well have been the\r\n""model for the engraver of the medal, shows the year 1767 on the wall of\r\n""the building. As disputed as the date of its erection is also its use as\r\n""prison during the Revolution. Wilson writes: \u201cThe date and the\r\n""architect\u2019s initials are still to be seen on the side of the building,\r\n""worked in wrought-iron characters, quaint and old. The Rhinelander\r\n""family has owned the property since 1790, and much of the land around it\r\n""has been in their possession much longer than that. When first erected\r\n""the house was used as a sugar-house, but the great interest in the old\r\n""building is in the memory of the use to which it was put in\r\n""revolutionary times. The grated windows, the dungeon-like underground\r\n""cellars, the general air of solidity and impregnability which impress\r\n""the observer at first sight, bear out the assertion, which has become a\r\n""creed among the neighbors, that during the Revolution the sugar-house\r\n""was diverted from its legitimate use and turned into a British prison,\r\n""where many an American patriot suffered not only imprisonment, but\r\n""cruelties and starvation.\u201d This was written by Wilson in 1892 in\r\n""commemoration of the then recent demolition of the structure. It seems\r\n""that it was the very same occasion that caused the issuance of the\r\n""medal, bearing the year of the building\u2019s demolition. Nevertheless, the\r\n""use of the Rhinelander sugar-house as a prison during the Revolution was\r\n""\u201cdenied by Stevens and others, who have presented testimony to disprove\r\n""it,\u201d as Stokes tells us. It seems almost impossible to decide the issue\r\n""which, in turn, renders the historical justification of the issuance of\r\n""the medal also doubtful.\r\n""\r\n""    [Illustration: No. 7\r\n""    Libby Prison Medal\r\n""    (Obverse)]\r\n""\r\n""No. 7 is the only medal known to the author referring to a military\r\n""prison in the Civil War.

The following quotation is an excerpt from\r\n""the pertinent introductory chapter in the now rare _Catalogue and\r\n""Program_ of the Libby Prison War Museum, first published probably in\r\n""1889 and later reprinted in the early eighteen-nineties:\r\n""\r\n""  \u201cThe removal of Libby Prison from Richmond, Va. to Chicago was a\r\n""  project never before equaled in the history of building moving and one\r\n""  that will not be surpassed for years to come. This famous old\r\n""  structure as a Confederate prison is too well known to need the\r\n""  repetition of its history, and it is enough to state that it was the\r\n""  palace prison of the South, and during the late war it held more than\r\n""  40,000 Union officers and enlisted men as prisoners. The project of\r\n""  removing Libby Prison to Chicago was thought of by a well-known\r\n""  Chicago business man who interested a syndicate of his business\r\n""  associates, and as a result they visited Richmond in the latter part\r\n""  of 1888 and took a thorough look over the ground.... Mr. Louis M.\r\n""  Hallowell, a well-known and experienced Philadelphia architect, was\r\n""  engaged to work on the spot. He made all of the working plans for\r\n""  taking the structure apart, shipping it to the cars and rebuilding it\r\n""  in Chicago. The work commenced in December, 1888, and as the building\r\n""  was taken apart each board, beam, timber and block of stone was\r\n""  numbered and lettered in such a manner that there was not the least\r\n""  trouble about placing these parts correctly together again in\r\n""  rebuilding.... Sending to Chicago required 132 twenty-ton cars ... the\r\n""  re-erection of Libby Prison ... was completed early in September. The\r\n""  Museum was opened to the public September 21, 1889.... It contains the\r\n""  most complete and valuable collections of Confederate relics in\r\n""  existence.\u201d\r\n""\r\n""The museum was situated on Wabash Avenue between 14th and 16th Streets.\r\n""The enterprise proved a failure, however. The Libby Prison War Museum\r\n""was torn down in 1899, according to information received from the\r\n""Chicago Historical Society. The Coliseum was erected on the site. The\r\n""prison wall on the Wabash Avenue is now incorporated in the facade of\r\n""the Coliseum, all other material used having been disposed of.\r\n""\r\n""The officers of the Libby Prison War Museum Association whose names\r\n""appear on the medal, are identifiable from their advertisements on the\r\n""covers of the _Catalogue_. The President, C. J. Gunther, was a\r\n""confectioner who advertised his candies; the Vice President, L. Manasse,\r\n""an optician; and the secretary-treasurer was a member of the law firm,\r\n""Schuyler and Kremer, \u201cattorneys at law and proctors in Admiralty.\u201d\r\n""\r\n""One would expect to learn that the medal was struck on some occasion\r\n""connected with the Libby Prison War Museum, either on the completion of\r\n""its rebuilding in Chicago or on its opening. This was, however, not the\r\n""case. There is no other indication as to when the medal was executed\r\n""except the year 1893 appearing on its reverse. It proves that the medal\r\n""must have been struck in connection with the Columbian Exposition held\r\n""in that year in Chicago. This is all that could be explored of its\r\n""history.\r\n""\r\n""Finally a token should be mentioned that refers to Civil War prisons,\r\n""though indirectly only. It is representative of a whole group of similar\r\n""tokens. In 1864-1865 a special committee of the United States Sanitary\r\n""Commission published the gruesome results of an inquiry into the\r\n""privations and sufferings of United States officers and soldiers during\r\n""their war imprisonment. It aroused, of course, the public at that time.\r\n""The United States Sanitary Commission, established in 1861, to cooperate\r\n""with the army, arranged a series of great fairs, popularly termed\r\n""\u201cSanitary Fairs,\u201d in order to raise funds for the relief of sickness,\r\n""the improvement of hospital sanitation, and the promotion of the health\r\n""conditions among the armed forces in general. The Commission distributed\r\n""during the war supplies to the value of fifteen million dollars, and\r\n""funds amounting to five million more were received into its treasury, at\r\n""least two-thirds of which were obtained from the numerous \u201cSanitary\r\n""Fairs.\u201d The first was held at Chicago in 1863, and many other cities\r\n""followed.\r\n""\r\n""Tokens of the kind of that pictured here as No. 8 were given to the\r\n""\u201ccheerful givers.\u201d The obverse of No. 8 shows Washington\u2019s head facing\r\n""the right, at each side four stars, the legend being: GEO.
